# 🌾 Harvesting-Price 🧑🏻‍🌾
🚀 This project leverages **machine learning** techniques to predict rice prices based on historical data from **Badan Pusat Statistik Indonesia (www.bps.go.id)**.

---

## 🎯 Overview
This system performs two key tasks:
1. **Rice Price Forecasting**: Utilizes historical price data to build a predictive model for future rice prices.
2. **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Provides insightful visualizations and statistical analysis of rice price trends.

This project is valuable for **farmers, traders, policymakers, and businesses** to make informed decisions based on price trends.

## 🏠 Project Workflow 📌
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing** 📊
   - Retrieves historical rice price data from Badan Pusat Statistik Indonesia.
   - Cleans and preprocesses the dataset for accurate forecasting.
2. **Machine Learning Model Training** 🤖
   - Implements ML models (Random Forest) for price prediction.
   - Evaluate model performance using standard metrics like RMSE and MAE.
3. **Price Forecasting & Visualization** 📈
   - Uses the best-performing model to forecast rice prices.
   - Provides visual insights with graphs and trend analysis.
